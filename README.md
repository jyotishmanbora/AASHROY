Homeless street people are prone to trafficking, drug abuse and other crimes. A large section of this population comprises of women
and children. They take shelter under bridges, on footpath etc. Effective solutions are required to monitor the living conditions and
place of their stay so that relief materials and proper health support can be provided to these homeless. Proper information of the
